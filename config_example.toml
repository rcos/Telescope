# The Telescope Config format is a serialized version
# of the structures in src/env.rs.
#
# For anyone using or developing telescope, this configuration template should
# be copied to config.toml and then modified to your needs.
#
# This file only contains 2 profiles (dev, live)
# but users may specify more arbirarilty using the profile objects.
# Profiles may override any/all of the global settings.
#
# Each required config option must be specified somewhere, either top-level
# or in some level of the active profile (which is specified using commandline arguments).
#
# Any option specified at top level and in a profile (or subprofile) is resolved
# as the specification with the most depth. when `telescope=trace` is active in
# the log level options then the options active at runtime are logged on server
# start up.
#

# [REQUIRED]
# specify the log level of the telescope server instance
# see https://docs.rs/env_logger/0.8.1/env_logger/ for syntax and options.

# [REQUIRED]
# Specify the URL of the RCOS central API. This default value is okay for
# testing locally in docker but should probably be changed in production.
